# react-counter-component
React component that displays a number (count) and has buttons to increment/decrement by 1, add/subtract 10, and reset count to 0. Doesn't allow the value of count to fall below 0 or go above 50 by disabling the appropriate buttons using conditional renders. Uses a state hook to update the component's state.
